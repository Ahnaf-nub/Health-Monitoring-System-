# Health Monitoring System

## Overview
The Health Monitoring System is a project developed using the TTGO ESP32 and MAX30102 sensor. It applies a Kalman filter and RMS value for accurate real-time monitoring and analysis of health parameters. This system is designed to be used in healthcare settings to monitor patients' vital signs and provide alerts in case of abnormalities.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of vital signs using MAX30102 sensor
- Application of Kalman filter for noise reduction
- Calculation of RMS value for signal analysis
- Data logging for analysis
- User-friendly interface

## Hardware Requirements
- TTGO ESP32
- MAX30102 sensor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable for programming and power
